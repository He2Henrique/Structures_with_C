# C and Structures

## Objetive.
C is a structural programming language so the goal is show the mains data strucutures and your methods and fuctions

## Explain the basics of C.
The firts files is a fast explanation about syntax

## Structures.
The most important thing here is like a amount of leago pieces that provide us to build new types of data for which kind of problem

### First one,Stacks and queues.
- Stacks LIFO(Last In Last Out) and Queues FIFO(Fist in first out);

~~~About Stacks
Stacks yours mains method is `push`(insert a value) `pop`(returns the deleted value) `peek`(just show the top element of the stack);
So is important to note that a Stack we just malipulate one of the side from the sequential structure and we don't need to move all the elements
all the time so the most of the cases when we have a size for the stack is more useful to use a array than a linked list.

### Linked List.
